# Prototypical-Network-Based-Out-of-Distribution-Species-Detection-for-Rainforest
## Project Overview
This repository stors codes for implementation of a NTU URECA Project Research Paper titled: Prototypical-Network-Based-Out-of-Distribution-Species-Detection-for-Rainforest, which proposes a framework for detecting Out-of-Distribution (OOD) species in tropical rainforests using Prototypical Networks (ProtoNets) and Vision Transformers (ViT). The framework enables few-shot learning for species classification with minimal labeled data. It also incorporates methods for improving OOD detection by reducing the overlap in similarity score distributions.
